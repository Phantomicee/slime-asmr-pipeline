The slime forms thick rounded folds that deform and glide slowly due to gravity, showing visible weight and delayed recovery. The background is a softly blurred rocky coastal overlook with gentle sea haze and warm dusk light. The color palette features deep sapphire blue with warm amber gold and subtle violet. Camera is completely static with stable cinematic lighting.",
    "audio_prompt": "Studio-clean audio of very slow, heavy, cohesive slime texture lasting exactly 10 seconds. Dense gelatinous folds and thick glide sounds with low event density, long pauses, and smooth long decay. No water, drips, splashes, or sharp peaks."

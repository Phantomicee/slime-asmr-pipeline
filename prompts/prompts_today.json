Incoming slime from above continuously drapes and folds in heavy rounded layers over existing slime on a horizontal smoked glass tabletop with deep glossy reflections. Composition: perfectly centered macro framing; slime mound and folds stay in the exact center with wide empty margins on all sides; no drift to edges or corners; no off-center framing.",

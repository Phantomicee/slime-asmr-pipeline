Incoming slime from above continuously drapes and folds onto the existing mass in slow, rounded layers with no visible start or end. Slime moves autonomously by gravity only, maintaining calm hypnotic motion. Composition: perfectly centered macro framing; slime mound and folds stay in the exact center with wide empty margins on all sides; no drift to edges or corners; no off-center framing.",
    "audio_prompt": "Silky, smooth, thick slime ASMR sounds with soft rounded folds and slow, calm settling. Slightly moist, cohesive texture with gentle compression and smooth release. Studio-quality close-mic recording, no voice, no music, no ambience. Duration: 8 seconds."

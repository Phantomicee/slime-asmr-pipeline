The background shows a softly blurred library corner with warm lamp glow. The slime, colored in arctic teal, silver, and midnight blue, slowly pours forming elegant ribbons that transition into a smooth glide with rounded soft folds and gentle deformation. The camera is static, capturing the calm slow glide and cohesive body of the slime with premium realistic reflections and stable cinematic lighting.",
    "audio_prompt": "Slow and gentle creamy slime texture with moderate event spacing. Sounds of smooth folding, soft wet movement, and gradual settling are heard, maintaining a calm, never busy tempo."

The softly blurred background shows a luxury penthouse lounge interior with dim nighttime city lights through large windows. The slime, in obsidian black with subtle iridescent highlights, slowly settles onto the surface, spreading gradually then gliding with visible weight and rounded edges. The camera remains completely static, capturing smooth glossy surface and slow rounded deformation under premium cinematic lighting.",

The softly blurred background is a minimalist interior studio with mixed warm and cool practical lights. The slime, colored in ultramarine blue, rose gold, and soft plum haze, slowly falls as a thick ribbon from above, stretching before settling, gently compressing, and then gliding in thick rounded folds with delayed recovery. The camera is completely static, emphasizing the heavy mass and slow viscosity with premium realistic reflections and stable cinematic lighting.",
    "audio_prompt": "Very slow-paced, heavy, cohesive slime texture with low event density. The sounds include long pauses, smooth wet glide, soft folds, and gradual settling without sharp transients."

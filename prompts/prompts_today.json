The slime slowly folds over itself, moving autonomously due to gravity. The background shows a softly blurred quiet mountain viewpoint with distant peaks under soft evening light. The surface is perfectly horizontal, camera static, lighting stable and cinematic.",
    "audio_prompt": "A dense, muted plop as the thick pearlescent slime settles on the ceramic surface — smooth and rounded, never sharp. A slow, sticky schlrrrp emerges as the slime folds over itself, thick and cohesive. Soft, tacky thummms follow as the slime compresses gently, the sounds continuous, calm, and unhurried with a subtle shimmering texture."

The background features a softly blurred luxury penthouse lounge with panoramic city skyline at dusk. The surface is horizontal, camera completely static, and lighting steady and cinematic.",
    "audio_prompt": "A slow, thick plop as the dense creamy slime spreads across the iridescent surface — rounded and heavy without sharpness. A low, cohesive schlrrrp accompanies the gradual compression, rich and tactile. The slime’s folds create soft, muted thummms and smooth gluuuhs, continuous and calming with a warm, organic texture."

A slow, sticky schlrrrp resonates as the slime compresses, thick and cohesive. Soft, tacky thummms and smooth gluuuhs follow as the folds deepen, continuous and calming with a rich, glossy texture."

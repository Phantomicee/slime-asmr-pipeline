Incoming slime from above continuously drapes and folds onto the existing mass, maintaining calm hypnotic motion. Composition: perfectly centered macro framing; slime mound and folds stay in the exact center with wide empty margins on all sides; no drift to edges or corners; no off-center framing. Background is a quiet forest clearing at sunrise with warm light shafts, softly blurred.",

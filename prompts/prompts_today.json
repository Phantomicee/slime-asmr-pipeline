New slime continuously arrives from just above the frame, folding over the existing slime in slow, rounded layers with subtle internal glow and rich saturated tones. Composition: perfectly centered macro framing; slime mound and folds stay in the exact center with wide empty margins on all sides; no drift to edges or corners; no off-center framing.",

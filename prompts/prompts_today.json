The slime slowly deforms and folds over itself with thick rounded folds and delayed recovery, moving autonomously under gravity only. The background is an upscale cocktail bar with neon accents and glass reflections, softly blurred. The palette features deep sapphire blue with warm amber gold and subtle violet. The camera is completely static, with no zoom or shake, and the surface is horizontal. No human presence or tools appear. Stable cinematic lighting.",
    "audio_prompt": "Continuous thick slime sound effect recorded close-mic. Slow pressure-driven mass movement of dense, cohesive gelatinous texture with heavy body and muted highs. The sound features constant slow deformation and folding over itself under pressure. No liquid flow, dripping, pouring, splashing, or bubbles. Studio-clean audio of exactly 10 seconds duration."
